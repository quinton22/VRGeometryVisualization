# Virtual Reality Geometry Visualization

## Contributors
Quinton Hoffman with oversight from Prof. Ole Molvig and Prof. Corey Brady

## Goal
The goal is to help young students better visualize geometry. From dimensionality to how volumes add together. Currently, teachers use in curriculum manipulatives to help students visualize geometry. One such manipulative is a board with paint and a paint scraper. This allows students to see how one dimension, the length of the paint scraper, affects two dimensions, when the scraper is dragged across the board. The idea is that VR is a better platform for visualizing this concept. Not only can this be done in two dimensions, it can also be extended to three.

## Features
- Creation of a line in 3D space
- Creation of an area by extruding a line
- Creation of a volume by extruding an area
- Creation of a convex mesh by connecting lines together on a given plane
- Creation of a volume by extruding the mesh
- Lines, areas, and volumes all have grids which subdivide the shape into units

## In-Progress Queue
1. Localize the mesh to a plane given by the first points drawn by the user
2. Display a grid for the mesh to show area
3. Transfer to VR
4. Show measurements associated with shapes
5. Separate volumes and add volumes

## How to Use
Currently unfinished. To use, either clone or download the repository. Open using Unity 2019.3.7f1. Find the "MainScene" in the "Scenes" folder in the project hierarchy. The MainScene will contain a playable 3D version of the tool. Currently being added is "MainSceneVR" which will be the VR version. If you wish to run the app using VR, contact me about the Oculus application ID.
